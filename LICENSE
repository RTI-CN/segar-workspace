1. Purpose and Status
SEGAR (also referred to as “Segar”) is a closed-source, proprietary and confidential software project. This license governs any access to,
possession of, or use of SEGAR Source Code and/or Binary Packages, unless a separate Written Authorization (as defined below) expressly
supersedes or supplements this license.

ASSENT / ACCEPTANCE
By accessing, possessing, installing, loading, running, copying, modifying, or otherwise using SEGAR (whether Source Code or Binary Packages),
you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all terms and restrictions of this license. If you do not agree to any term,
you must immediately cease all use and delete all copies under your control.

2. Licensor and Ownership
Licensor: Wang Shiming (王士明) (“Licensor”).
All intellectual property rights in SEGAR are owned by the Licensor, and the Licensor exclusively manages all external licensing and cooperation.
The RTI team is an individual collaboration assisting in maintenance and extensions and is not affiliated with any company/organization; RTI team
members are not licensors and have no authority to grant any external license.

3. Definitions
(1) “SEGAR / Segar” means all SEGAR source code, headers, libraries, binaries, build scripts, interface definitions, documentation, configurations,
examples, and any modified or derivative versions thereof, and any related materials.
(2) “Source Code” means any human-readable code and related materials, including but not limited to C/C++ sources, headers, scripts, IDL files,
build files, etc.
(3) “Binary Package” means any compiled library, executable, SDK package, or other object/binary distribution (including debug symbols if provided).
(4) “Commercial” includes any direct or indirect business or commercial use, including but not limited to revenue-generating use, internal business use,
customer-delivered use, production deployment, business-critical use, paid services involving SEGAR, or any use supporting a commercial product/service.
(5) “Written Authorization” means an explicit written permission granted by the Licensor, including but not limited to a signed agreement or explicit email approval.
(6) “RTI Member / Contributor” means any RTI team member or other contributor who has contributed code/scripts/docs to the SEGAR codebase (including submissions,
merges, or accepted patches).
(7) “Core Platform Scope” means generic capabilities related to SEGAR as a platform/middleware (referenced to industry-standard middleware/platform capability boundaries;
ROS 2 platform/middleware-layer capabilities may be used as a reference), including but not limited to communications, discovery, serialization/IDL, parameters, services/actions, node/component model, toolchain,
build/deployment scripts, diagnostics/monitoring, performance and stability improvements, and compatibility adaptations. Core Platform Scope excludes any company/customer-
specific application/business logic, proprietary algorithms, private data, or undisclosed trade secrets.

4. No License by Default
No license or rights, express or implied, are granted by this notice or by possession of any part of SEGAR (Source Code or Binary Packages).
Any permission must be obtained only through Written Authorization granted by the Licensor.

5. Prohibited Unauthorized Use
Unless you have Written Authorization from the Licensor, you must not directly or indirectly:
(1) access, use, copy, modify, merge, compile, distribute, publish, disclose, or otherwise provide SEGAR Source Code to any third party;
(2) use SEGAR Source Code or Binary Packages for any Commercial purpose;
(3) distribute, sublicense, sell, rent, lend, assign, transfer, or otherwise provide SEGAR (Source Code or Binary Packages) to any third party;
(4) to the maximum extent permitted by law, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive source code or underlying implementation ideas
from any Binary Package;
(5) remove or alter copyright notices, SPDX identifiers/references, proprietary markings, or confidentiality markings.

6. Free Academic/Learning/Evaluation Binary Packages
The Licensor may make certain SEGAR Binary Packages available for academic/learning/evaluation purposes (“Free Packages”). With respect to Free Packages:
(1) Free Packages may be used only for academic/learning/evaluation purposes;
(2) Free Packages must not be used for any Commercial purpose without Written Authorization;
(3) Free Packages must not be redistributed, sublicensed, or transferred to any third party without Written Authorization;
(4) the reverse engineering restriction in Section 5(4) also applies to Free Packages.

7. Unauthorized Acquisition: Required Remediation
If you obtain or access SEGAR (Source Code or Binary Packages) without Written Authorization, you must immediately:
(1) cease all use;
(2) stop all distribution, disclosure, and sublicensing;
(3) delete all copies within your possession or control (including backups, mirrors, CI artifacts, and copies on storage media);
(4) make reasonable efforts to recall distributed copies or cause deletion of such copies;
(5) promptly notify the Licensor and cooperate in remediation and handling;
(6) provide a written certification/confirmation of compliance with the above remediation obligations upon the Licensor’s request.

The above remediation obligations do not limit the Licensor’s right to pursue any legal remedies and claim damages (including reasonable costs incurred to stop the infringement).

Any purported authorization, license, or permission granted by an unauthorized party is void ab initio.

8. Contribution Compliance (RTI Team and Contributors)
RTI Members and any contributors must comply with applicable local laws. Contributions to SEGAR must be limited to generic code/scripts/docs within the
Core Platform Scope. Contributors must not submit:
(1) any application/business-specific code unrelated to general platform capabilities;
(2) any proprietary or confidential information of any employer/customer, trade secrets, undisclosed data, or restricted materials;
(3) any unauthorized third-party intellectual property (including employer-restricted code/materials, or customer proprietary/patent-sensitive implementation details).

If any such content is inadvertently contributed, it must be promptly reported to the Licensor and removed, and the contributor shall cooperate in remediation.

9. Additional Conditions for Commercial Use (RTI Contributions / Non-Compete Arrangement)
For any Commercial authorization, the commercial user acknowledges and agrees that if it employs or manages RTI Members/Contributors, then—provided that:
(a) no confidential information, trade secrets, or third-party IP of the commercial user is disclosed; and
(b) the contributions are limited to the Core Platform Scope,
such personnel may contribute generic platform patches/scripts/fixes/improvements to SEGAR as a permitted compliant activity.

The commercial user shall not, while continuing its Commercial use of SEGAR, treat such compliant contributions within the Core Platform Scope as a non-compete violation solely on that basis.

If the commercial user cannot accept the above arrangement, or demands that such personnel stop the above compliant contributions, the commercial user shall first consult
with the Licensor in writing to define a handling plan. If no agreement is reached, the Licensor may terminate the Commercial authorization for that commercial user;
where the applicable Written Authorization document contains specific termination/termination procedures, such document shall prevail.

10. Confidentiality
SEGAR Source Code and any non-public related materials are confidential. Without Written Authorization, you must not disclose them to any third party.

11. Disclaimer
To the maximum extent permitted by law, SEGAR and Free Packages are provided “AS IS” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, or error-free operation.

12. Strong Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law:
(1) Free Packages: the Licensor shall have no liability for any loss or damages arising from or related to Free Packages;
(2) exclusion of damages: the Licensor shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenues,
business opportunities, goodwill, data, or business interruption, regardless of the theory of liability (contract, tort including negligence, strict liability, or otherwise),
even if advised of the possibility of such damages;
(3) liability cap: if the above limitations are held unenforceable, the Licensor’s aggregate liability related to SEGAR shall not exceed:
(a) the actual amount paid to the Licensor under the specific Written Authorization giving rise to the claim; or
(b) if no fees were paid, zero (0).

Nothing in this section excludes or limits any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

13. Enforcement and Remedies
Any unauthorized use, distribution, disclosure, or commercialization may cause irreparable harm. The Licensor may seek all available legal and equitable remedies,
including injunctive relief and damages.

14. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution (PRC)
This license is governed by the laws of the People’s Republic of China (excluding conflict of law rules).
Any dispute arising out of or relating to this license or SEGAR shall be submitted to the competent People’s Court with jurisdiction at the Licensor’s domicile.
