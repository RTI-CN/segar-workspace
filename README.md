# segar-workspace

## Overview

**This repository is the user workspace for the SEGAR (Segar) operating system. It provides a practical environment to develop, extend, build, and deploy robot applications.**
- Segar is a robotics operating system for cross-industry use. It is compatible with mainstream software and hardware ecosystems, and combines an integrated toolchain with strong engineering capabilities to help teams build business and data workflows faster while reducing delivery time, operations cost, and overall system complexity.
- Segar includes deterministic scheduling, automatic message synchronization, built-in alert interfaces, and unified QoS management. It is optimized for throughput, latency, jitter, and resource usage, and provides integrated tooling such as launch, monitor, recorder, and tracing, with support for mainstream third-party ecosystem tools.
